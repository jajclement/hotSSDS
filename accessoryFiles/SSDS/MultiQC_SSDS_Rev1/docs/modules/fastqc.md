The FastQC module parses results generated by
[FastQC](http://www.bioinformatics.babraham.ac.uk/projects/fastqc/),
a  quality control tool for high throughput sequence data written
by Simon Andrews at the Babraham Institute.

FastQC generates a HTML report which is what most people use when
they run the program. However, it also helpfully generates a file
called `fastqc_data.txt` which is relatively easy to parse.

A typical run will produce the following files:
```
mysample_fastqc.html
mysample_fastqc/
  Icons/
  Images/
  fastqc.fo
  fastqc_data.txt
  fastqc_report.html
  summary.txt
```
Sometimes the directory is zipped, with just `mysample_fastqc.zip`.

The FastQC MultiQC module looks for files called `fastqc_data.txt`
or ending in `_fastqc.zip`. If the zip files are found, they are
read in memory and `fastqc_data.txt` parsed.

You can customise the patterns used for finding these files in your
MultiQC config using the following base - see the docs for more
details..
```yaml
sp:
    fastqc:
        data:
            fn: fastqc_data.txt
        zip:
            fn: _fastqc.zip
```

Note that the directory and zip file are often both present. This
will mean that the same data is parsed twice, but as the same sample
name will be generated it will simply overwrite itself.
